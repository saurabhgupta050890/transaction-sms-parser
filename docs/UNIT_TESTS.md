# How to run Unit Tests

Data driven unit testing setup is created for this project. I have choosen excel for the data input as its easy to use and setup.

Steps to run unit tests:

1. Rename file `src/tests/testCases.example.xlsx` to `testCases.xlsx`.
2. Paste your test data in the excel sheet in the exact format. (DO NOT MODIDFY EXCEL STRUCTURE)
3. Run script `node scripts/prepareTestData.js`
4. A json file will be generated at `src/tests/testCases.json`
5. Run command  `npm run test`


## Excel Guide

Test case excel has following columns:
1. name: name of the test case
2. message: Actual SMS
3. accountType: Expected account type (WALLET, BANK, CREDIT)
4. accountName: Expected account name
5. accountNumber: Expected account number
6. transactionAmount: Transaction amount
7. transactionType: Transaction type
8. balanceAvailable: Available balance (if present)
9. balanceOutstanding: Outstanding balance (in case of credit cards)

## Test Data prepareration

1. On Android you can use [SMS, Call - XML, PDF, CSV(Super Backup & Restore)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greenchills.superbackup) to export inbox as csv
2. Put the .csv files in `data/csv`
3. Run script `node scripts/prepareTestData.js`
4. 2 excel files will be genrated `filtered.xlsx` and `ignored.xlsx`
5. Append contents of `filtered.xlsx` to `testCases.xlsx`

Note: `ignored.xlsx` might also contain tranaction messages which were not able to parse.
